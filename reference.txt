Write two C programs to implement the one time pad Encryption and Decryption algorithm as shown in the last video of the first week from the course linked herewith. Watch the video (19m) and you will get your code there. Share with me a single GitHub repo containing Encryption, and Decryption program along the relevant files for message, key, encrypted and decrypted text. Make sure to run or test the program on any Linux environment possibly Kali.
